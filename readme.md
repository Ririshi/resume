# SSG resume website

This repository contains the code used to generate my resume static site. It is made with 11ty and largely adapted from the [resume template](https://github.com/learnwithgurpreet/11ty-resume-template) created by Gurpreet Singh. I also got some inspiration from [Tom Mount's post](https://medium.com/@tmountjr/creating-an-efficient-resume-workflow-with-static-site-generation-and-structured-data-ed9fe32cb2fc) to add support for multiple resumes, instead of only having a single page provided by the template.

I created this to have an easy way to share my resume with potential employers and to get some more practice in setting up simple websites. I hadn't used an SSG before for personal projects, so combining ideas from two different sources was a nice little project to get my hands dirty with.
